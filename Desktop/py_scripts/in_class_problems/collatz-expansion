# Monday, Sept 26: In-Class Exercise 2

# Using 1B from the last lab, write a function called collatz() that 
# 1. Takes in a number, num, as its argument.
# 2. Prints out the chain from the number to 1. 

def collatz(num):
    counter = 0 
    while num != 1:
        if num % 2 == 0: # if the number is even, run this code
            num = num // 2 # bonus
            print("Div by 2: ", num)
        else:
            num = (3 * num) + 1
            print("Times 3 Plus 1: ", num)
        counter += 1
        
    print("Length of chain:", counter)

collatz(22)
