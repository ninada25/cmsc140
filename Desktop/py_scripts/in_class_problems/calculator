# Exercise 3: Write a Calculator

# Write a very simple calculator that takes two numbers from the user and asks them whether they 
# want to add, multiply, divide, or subtract them. 
# Then it performs the correct operation and prints the value.

print("Welcome to the calculator.")
print("Enter number 1:")
num1 = int(input())
print("Enter number 2:")
num2 = int(input())
print("Enter operation [a,s,d,m]:")
op = input()
