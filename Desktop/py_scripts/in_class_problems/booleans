# Exercise 1: Booleans

print(7 < 8) # Write an expression that uses < and evaluates to True.
print((True or False) != False) # Write an expression that uses or and != and evaluates to True. 
print((True == True) and (3 >= 5)) # Write an expression that uses and, >=, and == and evaluates to False.

# Note: Python evaluates any number that is not 0 as True. Anything that is not empty will also evaluate to True. 
# print("cat" and "dog" >= ("dog" == "cat")) # a bit confusing, talked thru in class as someone's example
