# Exercise 2: If/Else

# Write a program that asks a user to type their name. Tell them if their name comes earlier or later in the
# alphabet than your name. If you have the same name, tell them that as well!

print("Hello! Please enter your name.")
user_name = input()
my_name = "Nina"

if user_name < my_name:
    print("Your name comes earlier in the alphabet than my name!")
elif user_name == my_name:
    print("We have the same name!")
else: 
    print("Your name comes later in the alphabet than my name!")
